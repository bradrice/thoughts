I suppose all software is complex, but wouldn’t it be nice if there was a way to write without having to worry so much about logging into a content management system. I thought, it would be better if I could just create my own html. I know html well&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I realized that I don’t even need that, what I need is a good text editor such as vim or &lt;a href="http://www.iawriter.com/mac/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IA&lt;/span&gt; Writer&lt;/a&gt;. Then I could write and save it somewhere and it can show up on my blog. That is sort of what Pelican is. It is a static site generator. It uses Python code and scripts to generate out all the site code from templates and markdown files. I write the markdown, save it and then run the script. Wala, a blog post. The only catch is to put some meta data into the top of the markdown so the script knows what to do with the&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My site is hosted on &lt;a href="http://www.webfaction.com"&gt;webfaction&lt;/a&gt;. So I found a good source to get me started: &lt;a href="http://martinfitzpatrick.name/article/pelicans-on-webfaction/"&gt;Pelicans on Webfaction&lt;/a&gt;. I got stuck a few times, but after banging away at it I now have the framework to get it off the&amp;nbsp;ground.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pelican"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="writing"></category></entry></feed>
