Title: A pelican post
Slug: a-pelican-post
Tags: pelican, python, writing

I’ve worked through different blog software such as Drupal and Wordpress and the thing that struck me was why the complexity for writing a simple blog. I suppose all software is complex, but wouldn’t it be nice if there was a way to write without having to worry so much about logging into a content management system. I thought, it would be better if I could just create my own html. I know html well enough.

But then I realized that I don’t even need that, what I need is a good text editor such as vim or [IA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/). Then I could write and save it somewhere and it can show up on my blog. That is sort of what Pelican is. It is a static site generator. It uses Python code and scripts to generate out all the site code from templates and markdown files. I write the markdown, save it and then run the script. Walla, a blog post. The only catch is to put some meta data into the top of the markdown so the script knows what to do with the story.

My site is hosted on [webfaction](http://www.webfaction.com). So I found a good source to get me started: [Pelicans on Webfaction](http://martinfitzpatrick.name/article/pelicans-on-webfaction/). I got stuck a few times, but after banging away at it I now have the framework to get it off the ground.
